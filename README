edroads
=======
edroads is a tool for processing Edinburgh Council road data.

The list of public roads is available from:

    http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/internet/transport/roads/road_building_public_roads_and_highways/CEC_list_of_public_roads

These .pdfs can be converted to XML-based Excel worksheets using:

    http://www.pdftoexcelonline.com/

edroads can then be used to convert the .xls files to .csv files for analysis.
